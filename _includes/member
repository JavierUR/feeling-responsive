*   This include lets you easily a member image and description
*
*   You can use the following kinds of alerts:
*
*    - warning  (foundation built-in)
*    - info     (foundation built-in)
*    - success  (foundation built-in)
*    - alert    (foundation built-in)
*    - text     (foundation built-in)
*    - terminal (custom, see Alerts in _sass/_09_elements.scss)
*    - ...      (define your own: .alert-box.<alert-type> { @include alert-style(<bg-color>);)
*
*   You can even use markdown and <html>-tags inside the alert, but beware to use " and ' properly; for example:
*
*       {% include alert info='Show an info alert with <b>outstanding</b> <a href="#info">information</a>.' %}
*
*       {% include alert info='Show an info alert with *outstanding* [information](#info).' %}
*
*       {% include alert info='Show an info alert with *outstanding* <a href="#info">information</a>.' %}
*
*   You can also call for additional classes to be put on the alert div:
*
*       {% include alert success="Yay! you did it!" classes='round' %}
*
